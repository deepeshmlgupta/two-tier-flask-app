This is a simple Flask app that interacts with a MySQL database. The app allows users to submit messages, which are then stored in the database and displayed on the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory to store your MySQL environment variables:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

4. Open the `.env` file and add your MySQL configuration:

   ```
   MYSQL_HOST=mysql
   MYSQL_USER=your_username
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MYSQL_DB=your_database
   ```


## Notes

- Make sure to replace placeholders (e.g., `your_username`, `your_password`, `your_database`) with your actual MySQL configuration.

- This is a basic setup for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should follow best practices for security and performance.

- Be cautious when executing SQL queries directly. Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

- If you encounter issues, check Docker logs and error messages for troubleshooting.
